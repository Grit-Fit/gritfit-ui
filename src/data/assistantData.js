  // Timing & Routine Hacks
  "Set a Pre-Workout Water Alarm – Use a reminder app to alert you 3 hours before your workout to drink up.",
  "Pair It with an Existing Habit – Link hydration to a habit you already do at that time (e.g., if you check emails at 4 PM, drink water then).",
  "Use a 'Pre-Workout Hydration' Bottle – Have a designated 600ml bottle specifically for this task to make it effortless.",
  "Chill Your Water for Refreshing Sips – Cold water is easier to drink in larger quantities.",

  // Flavors & Alternative Hydration Methods
  "Electrolyte Boost Without Sugar – If plain water feels too bland, add electrolytes or a pinch of sea salt for better absorption.",
  "Fruit-Infused Water – Add lemon, cucumber, or berries to enhance taste while keeping it light.",
  "Herbal Tea Alternative – If you don’t like water, caffeine-free herbal tea (chamomile, mint) works just as well.",
  "Coconut Water (Low-Sugar Option) – If you tolerate it well, it's a great natural electrolyte source.",

  // Practical Drinking Strategies
  "Use a Straw for Quick Consumption – People tend to drink more and faster using a straw.",
  "Drink 200ml Every 30 Minutes – Instead of chugging 600ml at once, split it into manageable parts.",
  "Pair It with a Light Snack – Hydrating while eating (e.g., with Greek yogurt or an apple) makes it more digestible.",
  "Drink Room Temperature Water – Ice-cold water may slow digestion and cause discomfort before a workout.",
  "Pre-Measure 600ml in a Visible Spot – Keep your hydration bottle on your desk, next to your phone, or in your bag so you don’t forget.",

  // Mindset & Behavioral Tricks
  "Visualize the Workout Performance Boost – Remind yourself that proper hydration improves endurance, reduces cramps, and prevents early fatigue.",
  "Link Hydration to Muscle Gains – Dehydrated muscles recover slower, so if hypertrophy is your goal, water intake matters!",
  "Use a 'No Workout Without Pre-Hydration' Rule – Make it a non-negotiable ritual to drink before training.",

  // Emergency Solutions
  "Hyper-Hydrate in Small Intervals – If you’re close to workout time and forgot to drink, have 150ml every 10-15 min instead of chugging all at once.",
  "Sip While Warming Up – If you didn’t get all 600ml in before, continue drinking during warm-ups to avoid last-minute dehydration.",

  // 1) Habit & Routine Strategies
  "Pre-Decide Protein Sources – Before your meal, know what protein you’ll eat (e.g., tofu, Greek yogurt, lentils) to avoid last-minute indecision.",
  "Use the 'First Bite Rule' – Always eat protein first before carbs and fats to make sure you get it in.",
  "Visual Cue Reminder – Place a sticky note on your fridge or set a daily phone reminder for lunchtime & dinnertime protein intake.",
  "Plan for Leftovers – Double your protein portion at dinner so you already have it prepped for the next day's lunch.",

  // 2) Making Protein More Enjoyable & Effortless
  "Flavor it Up – Use spices, sauces, or marinades to make your protein source enjoyable (e.g., smoked paprika + lemon on tofu).",
  "Mix & Match – Combine two protein sources in one meal (e.g., chickpeas + paneer in a salad).",
  "Turn It into a Ritual – If you love wraps, curries, or bowls, make them protein-dense versions (e.g., chickpea curry with extra Greek yogurt).",
  "Dips & Spreads Trick – Hummus, cottage cheese, or Greek yogurt-based dips can add protein without feeling like 'protein food.'",
  "Always Have a Go-To Quick Option – If you’re short on time, instant protein sources (protein bars, canned beans, pre-cooked lentils, smoked tofu) should always be in your kitchen.",

  // 3) Measuring & Tracking Without Stress
  "Use Your Hand – No need for a scale—your palm is roughly 25g of protein worth of tofu, lentils, or paneer.",
  "Make Protein the Largest Portion on Your Plate – Fill at least ⅓ of your plate with a protein source before adding other food.",
  "Batch Cook & Portion Ahead – Prepping 3-4 servings of protein at once saves time and ensures you don’t skip it.",
  "Label Meal Containers by Protein Content – If meal-prepping, write '25g protein' on your food container so you know what’s inside.",

  // 4) Mindset & Psychology Tricks
  "Think 'Protein = Muscle Growth' – Your body can’t store protein, so skipping a meal delays your gains—this reminder helps you stay on track.",
  "Reward Yourself for Consistency – Hit your target for 10 days? Treat yourself to something (new gym gear, a fun meal).",
  "Have a Backup Plan for Eating Out – If at a restaurant, check the menu beforehand and pick a meal that ensures you get enough protein.",
